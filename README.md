# LMI Solver
LMI solver for the analysis of affine quadratic stability regions This MATLAB script solves a system of LMIs of a Lyapunov function of an LPV system and yields two solutions for a given varying parameter value.

Solve_Sys_of_LMIs.mlx is an MATLAB tutorial or an introduction to solving LMIs and Robost Control Toolbox.

Stability_analysis.mlx is the actual analysis part for the stability.
